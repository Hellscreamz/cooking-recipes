      “There is no sincerer love than the love of food.”- George Bernard Shaw <br>

      <br> Well, I do not know about you but this saying is absolutely true for a foodie like me. <br> And considering my open admission here, 
      a career behind the stove would have been an ideal choice for me. But alas! <br>
      My skills with pans and salts are not as enhanced as my taste buds. <br>
      
      India as a nation has always considered it to be a given that a lady should know her way around the kitchen. <br>
       However, 
      the times are changing and there are many men around the world who are working really hard to rule the kitchen. 
      <br> (I hope Indian men take the hint!) <br>
      
      So, if you too have the inclination to learn and master the flavours and cuisines of the world, 
      then a career as a Chef would be an ideal choice for you. And to bring a little inspiration in your life, 
      this article talks about some famous chefs and their success stories.</p>
